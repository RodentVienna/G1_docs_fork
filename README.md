The first Gantry upgrade for the Ender 6.

This is deprecated (Now WidowMaker) and no longer worked on but can still be used.

Notes: This grantry design is based on the RatRig V-Core 3 Idler set from Mellow or Bearings and MGN9H rails on Y axis. It will not work with GT2 idlers or MGN12H. <br />
X-2020-Extrusion 395mm ( Will have to drill a hole for the M5 screw to go thought the extrusion) <br />
